To install the script and man pages in the standard areas, 
give the sequence of commands

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

If you want to install the script in your own private space, use

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/private/perllib \
       INSTALLMAN1DIR=/my/private/perllib/man/man1 \
       INSTALLMAN3DIR=/my/private/perllib/man/man3      
  make
  make test
  make install

Any libraries installed in such non-standard places may then
need to have the appropriate path to them specified in the script.

Note that `make test` may not necessarily be enabled.
