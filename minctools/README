MINC Tools

This package is a collection of tools that work on MINC format
images.

 * rawtominc, minctoraw, mincextract - format conversion
 * mincheader, mincdiff, mincinfo, minchistory - file information
 * mincedit, minc_modify_header - header manipulation
 * mincresample - arbitrary volume resampling
 * mincreshape - extraction of volume sub-cubes, image flipping,
      dimension re-ordering, type conversion
 * mincconcat - concatenating or interleaving images from multiple
      files
 * mincmath - perform simple math on files
 * minccalc - perform more complicated math on files through an expression
 * mincaverage - average minc files
 * mincstats - calculate statistics across voxels of a file
 * minclookup - lookup table operations for arbitrary re-mappings of
      intensities
 * worldtovoxel, voxeltoworld - coordinate conversion
 * xfmconcat, xfminvert - generalized transformation utilities
 * mincview - simple image display using xv or ImageMagick
 * mincpik - generate picture from slice through volume


INSTALLATION

Compilation and installation is now done with CMake. Use these steps:

1. Compile

   $ cmake CMakeLists.txt
   $ make

Note that if you have installed libminc in a non-standard location
(in this case /opt/local/minc) you will have to tell CMake where to find 
it as such:

   $ export LIBMINC_DIR=/opt/local/minc
   $ cmake CMakeLists.txt
   $ make
   
Similarly if you'd like to install minc-tools in this same location you
will need to do this:
   
   $ export LIBMINC_DIR=/opt/local/minc
   $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/local/minc CMakeLists.txt
   $ make


2. Install

   $ sudo make install
