Installation

   ana2mnc is a self contained perl script, all you need to do is change the
   first line of the script to reflect where your version of perl 5 resides.
   
   ana2mnc uses the GetOpt::Tabular module for argument parsing. If you do
   not have this installed already, it can be obtained from www.cpan.org
   
   To "make" the other utilities (mnc2ana, ana_show, spm2mnc, spm2xfm, spm_show)
   Run the shell script 'make_links'.  The resulting files are merely symlinks
   to ana2mnc.  The different names are required in order that ana2mnc knows what
   it is doing.  This mechanism may well be replaced in the future.. :)
