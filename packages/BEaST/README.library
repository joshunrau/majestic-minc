This explains how to download and install existing libraries for BEaST.

0. Optionally install MINC Tool Kit as explained here:
http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/ServicesSoftwareMincToolKit
Step 2.4 below and the normalization script (beast_normalize) depends on MINC tools.

1. Download and install ICBM BEaST library
1.1 Download the latest beast library here http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/tgz/
1.2 Extract the archive and move it to somewhere convenient, e.g. /opt/minc/share
$ tar zxf beast-library-1.1.tar.gz
$ sudo mv beast-library-1.1 /opt/minc/share/

2. Download and install ADNI BEaST library (optional)
2.1 Login to the ADNI database at http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/
2.2 Go to "Advanced Image Search (beta)" and select "Pre-processed"
under "Image Types" and "Image Processing" under "Search Section" in
the left panel. Then write BEaST* in "Description" under "Image
Processing" in the main panel and hit "Search". You should get 120
images, 60 T1s and 60 masks, you can download. Select all and add to
collection (name it e.g. "BEaST library"). In the Data Collections
tab, download all the images in the collection as MINC. (Make sure you
have a java plugin installed. Otherwise you cannot
download. Instructions for Java setup is here:
http://www.duinsoft.nl/packages.php?t=en )

2.3 Source the minc-toolkit (if installed):
$ source /opt/minc/minc-toolkit-config.sh

2.4 Generate library by running:
$ beast_prepareADNIlib -flip <ADNI download directory> <BEaST library directory>
Example:
$ sudo beast_prepareADNIlib -flip Downloads/ADNI /opt/minc/share/beast-library-1.1

3. Test the setup
3.1 Normalize your data
$ beast_normalize -modeldir /opt/minc/share/icbm152_model_09c input.mnc normal.mnc normal.xfm
3.2 Run BEaST
$ mincbeast /opt/minc/share/beast-library-1.1 normal.mnc brainmask.mnc -conf /opt/minc/share/beast-library-1.1/default.2mm.conf -same_res


Tailoring your own library
--------------------------
The best way to improve your results is to populate the library with
images/masks from the same scanner as the the images you are trying to
segment. One way to do this is to run BEaST with the default ICBM/ADNI
images and then select the best masks among the results, possibly
perform some manual corrections, and put them into the library. Then
run BEaST again. This bootstrapping method can be performed
iteratively with increasing performance improvements.

To add your own images/masks you must downsample the images/masks to
2mm and 4mm voxel sizes. This can be done using minc_downsample from
the MINC Tool Kit package. For example:

$ minc_downsample --3dfactor 2 T1_1mm.mnc T1_2mm.mnc
$ minc_downsample --3dfactor 4 T1_1mm.mnc T1_4mm.mnc

You may also want to L/R flip the images to increase your N. This can
be done using flip_volume. For example:

$ flip_volume T1_1mm.mnc T1_1mm_flip.mnc

Finally, you need to update the library files to include your new images/masks. The files to update are:

library.masks.1mm
library.masks.2mm
library.masks.4mm
library.stx.1mm
library.stx.2mm
library.stx.4mm

Note that unless you always use -abspath when running mincbeast, the
paths in these files are relative to the BEaST library path. Other
than that there are no restrictions on file naming and
placement. BEaST assumes the same order of images/masks across the
library files, so pay special attention to the order of the file
names.
