	* fixed some string manipulations that were causing 
          segmentation faults

2005-04-07  Andrew Janke  <a.janke@gmail.com>

	* removed multiple #def MALLOC's replaced with GI_MALLOC
	    and friends as this was causing volume_io clashes
	* changed include orders and added #ifdefs for headers
	* rewrote design_matrix input routine to use volume_io
	    so that comments are possible.
	* rewrite of input routine also fixed an esoteric bug
	    that could happen with certain filenames in certain
		conditions that would cause incomplete reading of 
		the file
