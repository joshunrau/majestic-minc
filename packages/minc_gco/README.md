# MINC wrapper of graphcut algorithms

This programs are simple wrapper around Multi-label graph optimization library: http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/
It includes source code of gco-v3.0 , and therefore can be used only for research purposes.

To use this software, YOU MUST CITE the following in any resulting publication:

    [1] Efficient Approximate Energy Minimization via Graph Cuts.
        Y. Boykov, O. Veksler, R.Zabih. IEEE TPAMI, 20(12):1222-1239, Nov 2001.

    [2] What Energy Functions can be Minimized via Graph Cuts?
        V. Kolmogorov, R.Zabih. IEEE TPAMI, 26(2):147-159, Feb 2004. 

    [3] An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for 
        Energy Minimization in Vision. Y. Boykov, V. Kolmogorov. 
        IEEE TPAMI, 26(9):1124-1137, Sep 2004.

    [4] Fast Approximate Energy Minimization with Label Costs. 
        A. Delong, A. Osokin, H. N. Isack, Y. Boykov. In CVPR, June 2010. 

This software can be used only for research purposes. For commercial purposes, 
be aware that there is a US patent on the main algorithm itself:
