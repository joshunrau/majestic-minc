    Added "hash ref" mode to register_programs.
  [rev 1.10, 1997/09/25]

    Added the "interface to MNI::Startup" section on the `suppress_announce'
    environment variable conspiracy.

MNI/Startup.pm:
  [rev 1.10, 1997/09/30]
    Added the $orig_tmpdir stuff to ensure that we only nuke the temp directory
      we originally cook up in &startup.
    Rejiggered things to delay/avoid loading other modules if possible (~50%
      reduction in module overhead!).
    Changes to &startup:
      * only calls getcwd if necessary
      * makes $TmpDir into an absolute path in case TMPDIR env var is relative
        (thus simplified &cleanup to remove the return-to-$StartDir business)
    Revamped most of the docs explaining $TmpDir and cleanup; a few other
      small improvements.
  [rev 1.9, 1997/09/30]
    Changed so we only search %SIG for "known signals" under Perl 5.004 or later.
  [rev 1.8, 1997/09/25]
    Changed self_announce to pay attention to the `suppress_announce'
    environment variable, possibly set by the parent before spawning.

    Added MNI/DataDir.pm to SOURCE macro.

t/fork_test.pl:
  [rev 1.2, 1997/09/30]
    Made 'debugging' stuff require $DEBUG >= 2 (or >= 3 in some cases).

t/mincutil.t:
  [rev 1.2, 1997/09/25]
    Fixed to chmod $testcopy after creating it.

t/searchfiles.t:
  [rev 1.2, 1997/09/30]
    Added tests to ensure that search_directories doesn't modify its arguments.
    Changed some tests to expect '' from search_directories (only when '' is
      in the path).

t/spawn.t:
  [rev 1.4, 1997/10/01]
    Added "redirect to filehandle" and "register w/ specific override" tests.
    Now uses FileHandle module.
    Requires $DEBUG >= 2 to dump file lists.
  [rev 1.3, 1997/09/30]

  [rev 1.2, 1997/09/30]
    Added 'non-cleanup of custom temp directory' test.
    Changed the 'undefined $TmpDir' test -- this now means the tmp dir
      will get cleaned up anyways!
