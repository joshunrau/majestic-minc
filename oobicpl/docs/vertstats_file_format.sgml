Introduction
<p>
The <em>vertstats</em> file format is designed to hold auxilliary information
 about each vertex in a surface model. This can be some metric about
 each vertex, such as cortical thickness or curvature, or it can be
 resulting information from a statistical model. The file format is
 agnostic about the type of values it holds, it is, however, currently
 limited to scalar values only at each vertex.

</p>
<p>
A vertstats<em> </em>file is a plain text file. It is broken down into
 three parts. The first is the header, made up of a vaguely XML like
 hierarchical data structure, and open to any kind of information
 that can be held as a string. The data section is broken down into
 a short data header, which contains a name for every data column,
 followed by the columns of scalar data.

</p>

The Header
<p>
The header looks something like this:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;formula&gt;
y &tilde; V2 + V3
&lt;/formula&gt;
&lt;patient&gt;
&lt;name&gt;
John Doe
&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;birthdate&gt;
11/01/77
&lt;/birthdate&gt;
&lt;/patient&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

</verb>
</p><p>
The rules are the following:

</p>

<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Beginning and end tags are required for each element.
 <item>
Tags take the form of &lt;NAME&gt; and &lt;/NAME&gt;
 <item>
Tags have to be on a line of their own.
 <item>
The header must begin with &lt;header&gt; and end with &lt;/header&gt;.
 <item>
Any text inside of a header entry is legal outside of &lt;&lsqb;a-z&rsqb;+&gt;
 or &lt;/&lsqb;a-z&rsqb;+&gt;.
 <item>
If a header entry contains its own body as well as subheaders,
 the body must come before any subheader.

</itemize>
</p><sect>
The Data
<p>
The data part of the <em>vertstats </em>file consists of two parts: the
 first short part is a single line with space separated names for
 each of the data columns, i.e.:

</p>

<p>
<verb>
adj.r.squared fstatistic intercept slope.1 slope.2 slope.3 tstatistic.1 tstatistic.2 tstatistic.3

</verb>
</p><p>
This is followed by the data itself, also space separated for
 each column, with one line per vertex.
